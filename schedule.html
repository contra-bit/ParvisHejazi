	<h3>Repertoire</h3>
	<blockquote>"Being a pianist and composer, I highlight the importance of wide-range repertoire. Thus I am keen on bringing barely performed music to performance, such as Takashi Yoshimatsu's "Random Bird Variations" for piano duo or Dietrich Buxtehude's Choral Variations on "Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern" BuxWV223 in addition to standard repertoire. Having intensively dealt with style and performance practice of the Viennese School in general, but with fortepiano in particular, both Viennese Schools have a great impact on my artistic work. In the next season, you will hear me with works by Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Chopin and Berg. I will be happy to see you at one of my concerts."</blockquote>
