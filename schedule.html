	<h3>Join the adventure!</h3>
	<blockquote>'Although developed in hours of hard practice, artistry truly reveals itself in performance. I can't help but perform. What greater delight can there be for a musician, than to share the incessant joy of music with an audience? Through a vast array of different concert schemes, I try to reach all sorts of audiences; whether you are a traditional concert-goer or someone merely curious about what it is that makes people be fascinated by a guy called Mozart - if we can't share, there is no point in life. I look forward to seeing you.'</blockquote>
