	<h3>Repertoire</h3>
	<blockquote>"Being a pianist and composer, being involved with a great variety of artistic activities is extremely important to me, whether they be solo, concerto or chamber music programmes. My innovative recital programmes feature music from the 16th to the 21st century; from the traditional concert to projects with dancers, actors, light installations and more. On my contact page, you can book me for private recitals. Looking forward to seeing you in one of my concerts!"</blockquote>
